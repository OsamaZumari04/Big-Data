# Big-Data / Hotel Reservation Status

There are many reservations happening in hotels, most of them are accomplished successfully, but the rest may get cancelled which cost hotels empty rooms without getting benefit from them. In another meaning, these cancelations cause underutilization for hotels rooms and waste other potentials customers and guests. The statement is how we might increase the revenue by understanding the factors that affect the reservation status whether in checking in or cancelling them to prepare for any circumstances. Also, how we might ensure reservations will occur properly. In this project, big data tools were used to handle huge amounts of data in terms of finding patterns using descriptive analysis and predictive modelling for future forecasts. In addition, giving business needs.
